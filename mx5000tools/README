mx5000tools
===========

mx5000tools are tools to control the extra features on the Logitech MX
5000 bluetooth cordless keyboard. 

For the tools to work, you need to have the support for HIDRAW
compiled into your kernel. It currently only works on Linux, but it is
probably relatively easy to port it to other operating systems, by
rewriting the mx5000_open* and mx5000_send_reports functions.

mx5000tools includes 2 main components:

- libmx5000
  
  This library contains all of the code that directly interacts with
  the keyboard. Other applications can be implemented while using
  it. The only dependency it has is a working libc, the Linux kernel
  and the netpbm library.

- mx5000-tool

  This simple command-line tool allows users to control what is
  displayed on the LCD. It only depends on libmx5000.



This library was based on the work of E. Heidstra <boesj27@gmail.com>
on mx5000lib (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mx5000lib/)




TODO:
 - Display notification from the galago framework on the LCD?
 - Display the volume, maybe using the same gstreamer stuff used by
 the Gnome mixer applet.




Reverse-engineering left to do:
 - Understand how to control the content of the menus
 - Get information from Logitech about any other feature not exposed
 by SetPoint
  


EXAMPLES

To display "Tester" in the middle:
$ mx5000-tool --static --add-text Tester reg 30 25

To display "Tester" in huge on the whole screen:
$ mx5000-tool --static --add-text Tester huge 13 35

To display a long text on one line roughly in the middle with a
progress bar at 50% underneath:
$ mx5000tools/mx5000-tool/mx5000-tool --rolling "This is a really really long text that does not fit on one line" 100 0 20 --add-progressbar 20 10 reg 0 35

To display updateable text:
$ mx5000-tool --static --add-text "Tester     " reg 20 25 --ref
0
$ mx5000-tool --update 0 mx5000tools
